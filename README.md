> This repository is an official PyTorch implementation of the paper "E-MoFlow: Learning Egomotion and Optical Flow from Event Data via Implicit Regularization". We reavel that implicit regularizations can enable the mutual promotion of self-supervised learning for optical flow and egomotion.  Importantly, our method is capable of simultaneously learning the optical flow field and camera motion solely from event data.
